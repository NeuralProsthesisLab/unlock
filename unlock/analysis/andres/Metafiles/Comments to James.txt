Are the decoded target values (the ones giving us the decoded value given by the HSD decoder), saved after the end of a trial flag (-1), starting from zero or from 1?
I want to get the decoded target values but I realized the default value is always zero so it is impossible to know if a zero after -1 means the first target or if it is just a default zero.

In one of yesterday's files I find in this column 0,1,2,3 and 4 so I guess you signal the decoded targets from 1 to 4 (so zero is not a problem) but I am asking for peace of mind.
Thanks,

We need to signal adding a value in the 11th column everytime unlock starts flashing 
We need to signal the start of the grid app, data is collected even before, wen we are in the main screen, we need to signal when the grid app strats flashing. Also, signal when we leave the app, giving another value in the 11th column

NPL Unlock Repo

The purpose of the Unlock Project is to provide brain-machine interface (BMI)
technology to individuals suffering from locked-in syndrome (LIS),
characterized by complete or near-complete loss of voluntary motor function
with intact sensation and cognition. LIS is typically the result of brain stem
stroke or late stage amyotrophic lateral schlerosis (ALS). Being locked in has
been compared to being buried alive; sufferers of LIS often feel completely
isolated from friends and family due to their inability to communicate.

This repository contains the application-specific software used in the Unlock
Project.

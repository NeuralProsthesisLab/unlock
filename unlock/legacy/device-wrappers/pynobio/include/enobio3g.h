 *
 * The Enobio API consists on a set of classes that permit the access to the
 * Enobio device and the data that it provides.
 *
 * The main class to access the device is Enobio3G. This class provides methods
 * for opening the device, starting and stopping the data streaming and
 * configuring the device.
 *
 * The access to both the data streaming and the device status is made through
 * a producer-consumer protocol. The Enobio raw data streaming is accessed
 * through the producer Enobio3G::ENOBIO_DATA. The device status is accessed
 * through the producer Enobio3G::STATUS. By registering an implementation of
 * the IDataConsumer virtual class with the Enobio3G::registerConsumer method
 * the link between the poducer and the consumer is made. Thus the Enobio class
 * will call the IDataConsumer::receiveData method of all registered
 * IDataConsumer implementations every time a new sample is available or the
 * device status changes.
 *
 * The actual data or status is passed as a parameter to the
 * IDataConsumer::receiveData implementation through the PData class. The
 * pointer returned by the PData::getData method shall be casted to the
 * ChannelData or StatusData class depending on whether the implementation of
 * the IDataConsumer is registered to the Enobio3G::ENOBIO_DATA producer or the
 * Enobio3G::STATUS one.
 *
 * The implementation of the IDataConsumer::receiveData method shall take into
 * consideration that it will be executed from a different thread than the
 * Enobio one. So the operations done within the implementation shall be
 * thread-safe.
 *
 * Another consideration that the IDataConsumer::receiveData implementation
 * shall take into account is that the data accessed through the PData::getData
 * method is not accessible out of the scope of that method. That data is
 * deleted inside the Enobio class when all the IDataConsumer implementations
 * are called.
 *
 * The API can calculate the power of the signals provided by Eenobio in eight
 * different bands: Delta (from 0.1 to 3.5 Hz), Theta (from 4.0 to 7.5 Hz),
 * Alpha (from 8.0 to 13.0), Beta (from 14.0 to 30.0 Hz), Gamma (from 30.0 to
 * 100.0 Hz), SMR band (from 12.0 to 15.0 Hz) and two user defined bands. To
 * access these values, eight different producers are provided:
 * Enobio3G::POWER_DELTA, Enobio3G::POWER_ALPHA, Enobio3G::POWER_ALPHA,
 * Enobio3G::POWER_BETA, Enobio3G::POWER_GAMMA, Enobio3G::POWER_SMR,
 * Enobio3G::POWER_USERDEFINED_1 and Enobio3G::POWER_USERDEFINED_2. The rate
 * these producers provide a new power calculation can be controlled with the
 * method Enobio3G::setPowerCalculationRate. The number of samples that are
 * taken into consideration for the power calculation is controlled with the
 * method Enobio3G::setPowerComputingLength. The user defined bands are
 * selected by calling the methods Enobio3G::setUserDefinedBand1 and
 * Enobio3G::setUserDefinedBand2.
 *
 * The accelerometer is activated/deactivated by calling the
 * Enobio3G::activateAccelerometer method before starting the EEG streaming.
 * The data is received through the Enobio3G::ACCELEROMETER producer when the
 * EEG streaming is ON.
 *
 * The API can also configure up to five different power combination features.
 * The combination of the power in some specific frequency bands for a set of
 * channels placed on specific locations might provide relevant features (i.e.
 * information regarding affective state). The
 * Enobio3G::configurePowerCombinationFeatures method allows selecting up to
 * two sets of channels that will be used to extract the feature of interest as
 * well as the frequency bands for the two sets of channels and the
 * mathematical operation to combine the power from the set of channels.
 *
 * As an example, to extract information regarding valence the following
 * configuration might be used: Perform the subtraction operation over the
 * channel placed on F3 on the Alpha band and the channel placed on F4 filtered
 * on the Alpha band too.
 *
 * The length of the raw EEG signal which is used to perform the computations
 * is defined by the Enobio3G::setPowerComputingLength method.
 *
 * The obtained results are delivered through the
 * Enobio3G::POWER_COMBINATION_FEATURE_X producers (being X a number from 0 to
 * 4). The IDataConsumer::receiveData implementation connected to the producers
 * shall cast the pointer obtained through PData::getData method to the
 * ProcessedData class. The result of the combination is a single value stored
 * on channel 0 of the class.
 *
 * The results are delivered at rate defined by the
 * Enobio3G::setPowerCalculationRate method.

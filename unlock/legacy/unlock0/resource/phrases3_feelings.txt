I love you
Thank you
I'm doing very well
I'm having a good day
I like that
Glad you're here
That was funny
I'm tired
I'm sleepy
I want to be alone now
I would like company
I'm sorry
I'm sad
It's one of those days
I'm frustrated
I'm not comfortable
I don't like that
I'm feeling depressed
I want to cry
I'm feeling anxious
I'm feeling annoyed
I feel excited
I'm bored
I don't care

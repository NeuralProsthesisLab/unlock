Please scratch me.
Please change my position.
I would like to sit up.
I want to lay down.
I'm cold.
I'm hot.
That's too loud.
It's too bright in here.
It's too dark in here.
Take me to the living room.
Take me to my bedroom.
I want to leave.
I would like to be alone now.
What time is it?
What is my schedule today?
I want to watch a movie.
I want to listen to music,
Can you turn that off?
Can you change my clothes?
I want to go to the bathroom.
I want to take a bath.
What's going to happen?
Who was that?
Tell me why.

I'm in pain!
I'm choking!
Help!
I need my medication.
Call 911!
Fire!
My stomach is upset.
I really need to use the toilet.
My skin feels irritated.
Right there.
Lower.
Higher.
Left.
Right.
On my body.
On my head.
On my arms.
On my legs.
I'm having suicidal thoughts.
That hurts! Please stop!
There is something in my eyes.
I've had enough for today! 
Leave me alone!
It hurts there.

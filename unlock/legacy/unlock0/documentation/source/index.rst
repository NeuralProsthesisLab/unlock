The Unlock Project's documentation
==============================================

Welcome to the Unlock Project! Last updated |Today|

We are a non-profit group at Boston University dedicated
to creating and providing resources for un-conventional means of communication
to individuals who have lost voluntary motor control.
Specifically we are working to create brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)
for individuals with Locked-in Syndrome (LIS).
We have chosen to research non-invasive techniques to easily acquire brain signals,
and allow BCI users to live more comfortably by interacting with other people and their
environment.

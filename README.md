**Unlock** is a framework for programming brain-computer interfaces.  Development of the Unlock
framework is funded by the Adaptive Brain-Computer Interactions (ABCI) Capstone Project~\cite{abci}.

Our goal is to develop BCI technology to help individuals suffering from locked-in syndrome (LIS)[2]
communicate.  LIS is characterized by an almost complete inability to communicate.  With current
technology, unfortunately, we cannot achieve this goal.

We think, if more smart people are able to painlessly collaborate, then we have a better shot at
accomplishing this goal.  Therefore, our [simple] strategy is to focus on providing an awesome
programming framework that makes it easier for researchers and engineers to build BCI-based systems.
To this end, we employ a few simple ideas.  

We encapsulate as much as possible; this is kind of technical mumbo jumbo for trying to say that we
separate concerns.  We'll talk more about this later, but the basic idea is that you should not need
to know every corner of Unlock to create a new decoding algorithm or add a language model or add a
new acquisition device or create a new application.  

These could be different people with different skill sets, and we want them to be able to dive into
their area and be productive quickly.  One of the challenges with BCI technology is that it is
inherently cross-disciplinary; therefore, we want to lessen this burden as much as possible.

To support this goal, we need great documentation.  The documentation needs to be encapsulated too.
You should be able to get a high-level idea of how the whole system works and also locate details
about your specific area of interest without arduous effort.  

Finally, automate whenever possible; extra batteries included.  We want researchers and engineers
to be able to get going quickly.  Learning about all the dependencies and taking a bunch of manual
steps can be overwhelming.  Especially if someone just wants to hack out a quick idea.  

In summary, the goal is to give you a great platform to hack out an idea.

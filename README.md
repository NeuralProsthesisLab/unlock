Unlock Overview
----------------

Unlock is Python-based software framework for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) enabled application development.

Development of the Unlock framework is funded by the Unlock Project.  The goal of the Unlock Project 
is to provide BCI technology to individuals suffering from locked-in syndrome (LIS), characterized by 
complete or near-complete loss of voluntary motor function with intact sensation and cognition. 

LIS is typically the result of brain stem stroke or late stage amyotrophic lateral schlerosis (ALS).  
Sufferers of LIS often feel completely isolated from friends and family due to their inability to communicate.

This demos writing a wiki site using Spring Python.

== REQUIRED ==
1. You obviously need Python. This demo was coded against Python 2.4 and later tested against Python 2.5.

2. You need to have either installed Spring Python, or have a checkedout copy from Subversion.
   In case of the latter, make sure /path/to/springpython/src is in PYTHONPATH.

3. You need to have CherryPy 2 installed. We don't support CherryPy 3 yet.
	* sudo apt-get install python-cherrypy (Ubuntu)
   
== TO SET IT UP AND RUN IT ==

1. Type:
	python springwiki.py
	-- or --
	python springwiki-noxml.py
	
	One version uses an XML-based application context file to wire things together.
	The other uses a python class marked up with decorators to do the wiring.

2. You should get a message showing a server has been launched, including a hyperlink to http://localhost:8002/

3. That's it! Spring Wiki has been licensed under ASL, so you can include it inside
   another web app pretty easily.
